Here are some of the most common types of HPLC pumps based on flow rates:

### Nano LC pumps

These pumps are designed for very low flow rates, typically around 1 µL/min or less. They are used for highly sensitive applications such as proteomics, metabolomics, and peptide mapping.

### Micro LC pumps

These pumps are designed for flow rates in the range of several tens of µL/min. They are us ed for a wide range of applications, including pharmaceuticals, environmental testing, and food analysis.

### Semi-micro LC pumps

These pumps are designed for flow rates in the range of several hundreds of µL/min. They are used for applications such as drug discovery, metabolite profiling, and natural product analysis.

### Analytical pumps

These pumps are designed for flow rates in the range of several mL/min. They are used for routine analytical work, such as quality control testing in the pharmaceutical industry.

### Preparative pumps

These pumps are designed for flow rates in the range of several tens of mL/min or more. They are used for preparative chromatography, which involves isolating and purifying large quantities of a specific compound or mixture.
