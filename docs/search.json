    "text": "If you’re into (U)HPLC, then you know how frustrating it can be to transfer a gradient method between instruments and end up with inconsistent results. One of the most common culprits is the dwell volume (Vd), aka gradient delay volume.\nBut what is it exactly? Basically, the dwell volume is the amount of space within the fluidic path between where your eluents (the liquids used in chromatography) are mixed and where they hit the column. This includes all the tubing, valves, mixer, the autosampler loop and other components in your LC system (see the Figure).\nWhy does this matter? Well, if you’re doing a simple isocratic analysis (where the eluent composition doesn’t change), you don’t have to worry about it too much. But if you’re doing gradient chromatography (where the eluent composition changes over time), the dwell volume can have a big impact on your results. If you want to maintain the retention, selectivity, and resolution of your analytes, you need to know the dwell volume of your LC system. This is especially crucial when transferring gradient methods between different instruments.\nDifferent LC systems have different dwell volumes (could range from 100 uL to 1100 uL), depending on things like the type of pump you’re using and whether you have any mixers installed (See my other posts for pump designs). So if you’re transferring a gradient method from one instrument to another, or using a different column format, you might see differences in your results because of dwell time variations.\nTo adjust for differences in dwell volume, we can incorporate an isocratic hold into the method or utilize an injection delay. Even if you adjust the start time of the gradient to account for the system dwell volume, you may still encounter issues with inconsistent separation selectivity. That’s why it’s always a good idea to confirm the identification of analyte peaks.\nTo make sure you’re getting accurate results, it’s a good idea to understand and measure the dwell volume of your LC system. That way, you can adjust your methods as needed to account for any differences between instruments."

    "text": "A Quick Guide to Determining Dwell Volume\nHey there, fellow HPLC enthusiasts! Last time we discussed the importance of determining dwell volume. Today, we’re talking about dwell volume determination. It’s a quick and easy way to measure the dwell volume of your HPLC system.\nHere’s how to do it:\nFirst things first, you’ll need to replace your column with a Zero Dead Volume connector. Then, fill Solvent Line A with water and Solvent Line B with water containing 0.1% v/v acetone. Use UV detection at 265 nm to monitor the run.\nNext, run a gradient that’s typical of the gradients you usually use in the lab. I recommend a 0-100% B gradient run over 20 minutes at 2 mL/min. Keep the injector in the inject position during this measurement, because the injector loop volume is part of the dwell volume.\nAfter the gradient is run, you should see a chromatogram that looks like the one below. The baseline at the beginning of the chart denotes 100% A, while the final flat baseline represents 100% B. The sloping line in between indicates the transition between the two solvents.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo determine the dwell volume, measure the offset between the low and high baselines and locate the midpoint. Draw a horizontal line from the midpoint until it intersects the rising baseline. From this intersection, drop a vertical line to the time axis. Deduct half of the gradient time (\\(t_G\\)) (which is 10 minutes in this instance), and the remaining time is the dwell time. To convert the dwell time to dwell volume (\\(V_D\\)), apply the formula \\(VD\\) = \\(T_D x F\\), where F is the flow rate.\n\\[\nt_D = t_{50\\%} - t_G\n\\] \\[\nV_D = t_D * F\n\\] After determining the dwell volume for your HPLC system, it should remain constant unless significant modifications to the plumbing are made. However, it’s recommended to measure it periodically (every 6-12 months) during your system’s performance evaluation. This practice may even reveal other issues within the system. Who knows, it might even highlight other problems in the system!\nVoila! You now know the dwell volume of your LC system. This information will come in handy when you’re transferring methods between instruments and want to ensure consistent results."

    "text": "Mechanism of Action: Understanding Reciprocating Pumps\nAs we have learned about the differences between plunger and piston-based pumps, let’s delve into the mechanism of action of a reciprocating pump. A pump typically consists of a cylinder with a piston or plunger inside, along with check valves at the inlet and outlet. For the purpose of this explanation, we will focus on the plunger design, but the same mechanism of action applies to piston-based pumps as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the suction stroke, the plunger moves to the right (see the figure), causing the chamber inside the cylinder to expand. This expansion results in a drop in pressure, which opens the suction valve and allows fluid to enter through the inlet. The check valves prevent the fluid from flowing back and direct it through the pump. As the suction valve opens, the discharge valve closes.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the discharge stroke, the plunger moves towards the left (see the figure), pushing the fluid in the cylinder and increasing the pressure. This pressure increase closes the suction valve and opens the discharge valve, allowing the fluid to exit the pump. This process repeats continuously, resulting in a steady flow of fluid through the pump.\nOverall, the reciprocating pump’s mechanism of action is straightforward and efficient, making it a popular choice for applications that require precise and consistent flow rates, such as in (U)HPLC systems."

    "text": "Mechanisms for Driving the Pumps: Crankshaft vs. Camshaft\nIn a pump, the piston or plunger is responsible for creating the pressure difference that moves fluid through the system. To achieve this, the piston must be driven with a motor. There are two primary mechanisms that can be used to drive the piston: a crankshaft or a camshaft.\nA crankshaft is a simple mechanism that is commonly used in industrial applications. It is connected to an electric motor and rotates to generate the reciprocating motion of the piston. The crankshaft is connected to a connecting rod, which in turn is connected to the piston. As the motor turns the crankshaft, the connecting rod moves back and forth, causing the piston to move in and out of the cylinder.\nIn some pumps, the motor may be directly connected to the piston/plunger, eliminating the need for a crankshaft and connecting rod. This approach is often used in smaller pumps where simplicity and compactness are critical.\n\n\n\n\n\nA camshaft is another mechanism that can be used to drive a piston pump. It uses a series of cams to generate the reciprocating motion of the piston. The cams are mounted on a rotating shaft and are shaped like oblong circles. The shape of the cam determines the timing and speed of the piston’s motion.\nCamshaft-driven piston pumps are often used in applications where precise control of flow rate and pressure is required. The camshaft can be adjusted to change the shape of the cams, which in turn changes the motion of the piston. This allows for fine-tuning of the pump’s performance. However, camshaft-driven pumps can be more complex and expensive than crankshaft-driven pumps, so they are not as commonly used in industrial applications.\nIn conclusion, the choice of mechanism for driving a piston/plunger pump will depend on the specific requirements of the application. Crankshaft mechanisms are more commonly used in industrial applications due to their simplicity and lower cost, while camshaft mechanisms are often used in research and analytical applications, especially with UHPLCs, where precise control of flow rate and pressure is required.\nNotes:\nPumps-mechanism\nSeal and Plunger\nCam vs Crank\nPlunger change - Agilent"

    "section": "",
    "text": "When it comes to HPLC separations, there are two modes: isocratic and gradient. Isocratic elution refers to a constant concentration of the mobile phase throughout the chromatographic process. This method is simple and straightforward, but it has its limitations. Late-eluting peaks tend to become broad and flat, making them difficult to recognize. Additionally, selectivity does not change with column dimensions, meaning peaks elute in the same order.\n\n\n\n\n\nGradient elution, on the other hand, involves changing the composition of solvents either continuously or stepwise. This method allows for sharper peaks throughout the chromatogram and can achieve separations that are not possible with isocratic elution. Gradients are designed to start with weak elution conditions and end with strong elution conditions, providing adequate compound retention and elution.\nThere are different types of gradient designs, including linear and step gradients. Linear gradients are the most commonly used and help keep each compound’s band broadening to a minimum. Compounds stick to the column media until the solvent polarity is strong enough to dissolve and elute them. Step gradients are more challenging to use but can provide a complete separation of targeted compounds in narrow bands while using less solvent than linear gradients or isocratic elution.\nIn summary, both isocratic and gradient elution have their advantages and disadvantages. Isocratic elution is simple but limited, while gradient elution provides sharper peaks and more flexibility. Understanding the differences between these two modes can help chemists choose the best method for their specific separation needs."

    "section": "Dual piston/plunger pumps",
    "text": "Dual piston/plunger pumps\nDual-plunger pumps are a solution to the issue of flow and delivery pulses in single-plunger pumps. These pumps are widely used today and come in two types: in-parallel and in-series.\n\nDual-plunger in parallel\n\n\n\n\n\nIn-parallel pumps use two pumps that operate 180° out of phase to counteract the pulses of a single-plunger pump. These pumps are driven by a single cam, with one pump head filling while the other delivers. The output of the pumps is combined to ensure a constant flow, making them highly effective in LC pump design. Although less common in the analytical pumps market, dual-piston in-parallel pumps have been reintroduced in some UHPLC pumps, such as the Shimadzu AD models and the Thermo Vanquish pumps.\n\n\nDual plunger in-series\nThe dual-plunger in-series pump, also known as the accumulator plunger design, is commonly used in modern (U)HPLC systems. It consists of two plungers, with one delivering a single or mixed solvent to the other, known as the high-pressure plunger or accumulator. The two plungers have different displacement volumes and deliver at different rates, allowing for accurate compositional control and less pulsation. The pump has three check valves - an outlet, an inlet, and a middle check valve that acts as an inlet check valve for the top plunger and an outlet check valve for the bottom plunger. In one cycle, the top plunger delivers 1 mL/min to the column, with the outlet check valve open and the middle check valve closed, while the bottom plunger fills at 2 mL/min with an inlet check valve open and the middle check valve closed. In the alternate cycle, the bottom plunger delivers at 2 mL/min, with 1 mL/min serving to fill the top piston and the other 1 mL/min flowing to the column. Thus, 1 mL/min of mobile phase always flows to the column.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe accumulator plunger pump is preferred for its highly accurate compositional control and less pulsation, making it a popular choice for many (U)HPLC systems. It is used in various systems, including Agilent’s 1100, 1200, and 1260 with single motor design, Agilent 1290 with independent plunger drives, and Waters Alliance and Acquity UPLC instruments with independent plunger drives. The pump design has only three check valves, which is argued by manufacturers to enhance reliability compared to the dual in-parallel design. Additionally, the accumulator plunger pump usually has only one traditional ball-type check valve between the two plunger chambers, as there is no need for an outlet check valve since either the top or bottom plunger is always supplying flow to the column."

    "text": "Check Valves\nThe check valves play a crucial role in controlling the flow direction of the mobile phase in the pump. They consist of a ruby ball and a sapphire seat that are lapped to ensure a tight seal when the ball is resting on it. The valves operate based on pressure and gravity to open and close.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite their importance, check valves are often the least reliable parts of the pump. The most common design includes a ruby ball and sapphire seat that are slightly ground or “lapped” to match the curvature of the ball for better sealing. When the pressure beneath the check valve is higher than above it, the ball is lifted from the seat, allowing solvent to flow through the hole in the seat. When the pressure is equal on both sides of the valve or higher on the top, the ball settles onto the seat, providing a seal.\nInlet check valves are more prone to sticking than outlet check valves because of the pressure within the pump. To address this issue, many pumps now feature “active” check valves on the pump inlet. These valves use mechanical assistance, such as a spring and solenoid-actuated lifting device, to ensure proper seating and prevent sticking. The active check valve design is more reliable and is not subject to sticking when using acetonitrile.\nIt is worth noting that the inlet check valves of many modern UHPLC pumps use active check valves, regardless of whether the in-parallel or accumulator-plunger design is employed. This ensures consistent and reliable performance, critical for accurate and precise separation and analysis in chromatography."

It consists of a polymeric ring that encircles the plunger with a groove containing a spring on the high-pressure side. The spring helps to create a better seal by pulling the lip of the seal against the piston. The high liquid pressure in the pump chamber also aids in pushing the lip of the seal against the surface of the plunger, acting like a squeegee to keep the mobile phase within the pump chamber. Although the sealing process is not perfect, it allows a thin film of mobile phase to remain on the plunger surface, lubricating the plunger-seal interface and preventing premature wear of the seal. Proper maintenance and replacement of the pump seal are crucial for optimal performance and longevity of the pump."

    "text": "What is UHPLC or UPLC?\nUltra High Performance Liquid Chromatography (UHPLC), also known as Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC), is an advanced technique used in analytical chemistry to achieve better separation efficiency, improved resolution and shorter analysis times.. This innovative method uses HPLC columns with mean particle size diameters of less than two microns, combined with new commercially available instrumentation to achieve optimal linear velocities.\nOne of the key benefits of UHPLC is its ability to provide superior resolution. This is achieved by using columns with smaller particle sizes, which allows for more efficient separation of compounds. The increased resolution provided by UHPLC allows for the detection of trace amounts of compounds that would otherwise go unnoticed.\nAnother advantage of UHPLC is its ability to reduce analysis times. With traditional HPLC methods, analysis times can take hours or even days. UHPLC, on the other hand, can deliver results in a matter of minutes. This is particularly useful in industries such as pharmaceuticals, where time is of the essence."

    "text": "The Science Behind HPLC: How Liquid Chromatography Works\nHow does HPLC work? Essentially, it involves pumping a liquid mixture through a column filled with tiny particles that have different properties, allowing them to interact differently with the mixture components. As the mixture passes through the column, the components separate and are detected by a detector at the end of the column.\n\nThe HPLC instrument typically consists of four major components: a pump, autosampler, column, and detector. The pump pushes the mobile phase (usually a solvent) through the system at a specified flow rate, while the autosampler injects the sample into the mobile phase. The sample travels with the mobile phase from the injection point to the head of the column, where the physical separation of the compounds occurs on the stationary phase. After elution from the column, the separated sample components travel to the detector, which generates an electrical signal based on specific properties of the analytes. The signal is then translated by a computerized data system into a chromatogram of analyte signal versus time.\nThe stationary phase in HPLC can be a solid material packed into the column or a liquid adsorbed onto a solid support. The choice of stationary phase and mobile phase is crucial for the separation and analysis of compounds, and the method can be adjusted to optimize the separation based on the specific requirements of the analysis."

    "text": "Suitable Samples for HPLC\nHere, we will discuss the suitable samples for (U)HPLC analysis.\n(U)HPLC analysis has no volatility issues, meaning it can analyze samples that are not affected by changes in temperature. However, the analyte must be soluble in the mobile phase. The mobile phase is the liquid that flows through the column and carries the sample components. Therefore, the solubility of the sample in the mobile phase is crucial for successful analysis.\n(U)HPLC can analyze samples over a wide polarity range and is capable of analyzing ionic samples. The mobile phase components are selected to ensure sample solubility. The polarity of the mobile phase can be adjusted to separate components based on their polarity. This makes HPLC a versatile technique for analyzing a wide range of samples.\n(U)HPLC has no real upper molecular weight limit, meaning it can analyze large molecules such as proteins. Large proteins of many thousands of Daltons may be analyzed, making (U)HPLC a valuable tool in protein analysis. However, solubility in the mobile phase may preclude the analysis of very large molecules."

    "text": "Application areas of (U)HPLC\nAs technology advances, the need for accurate and reliable analysis of various substances becomes increasingly important. One such method for analysis is High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). But what types of samples are suitable for HPLC analysis?\nFirstly, HPLC is commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry for drug analysis. This includes testing for impurities, degradation products, and determining the purity of the drug substance. Therefore, samples such as tablets, capsules, and injections can be analyzed using HPLC.\nIn addition to pharmaceuticals, HPLC is also used in the food industry. For example, HPLC can be used to analyze food additives, such as preservatives and colorants, as well as contaminants like pesticides and mycotoxins. Samples such as fruits, vegetables, grains, and meats can all be analyzed using HPLC.\nEnvironmental testing is another area where HPLC is commonly used. HPLC can be used to analyze water samples for contaminants such as heavy metals, pesticides, and herbicides. Air samples can also be analyzed for pollutants such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and particulate matter.\nFinally, HPLC can be used in forensic analysis. For example, HPLC can be used to analyze blood and urine samples for drugs of abuse or to determine the presence of alcohol. Additionally, HPLC can be used to analyze DNA samples for forensic purposes.\nIn conclusion, HPLC is a versatile analytical technique that can be used in a variety of industries and applications. Samples such as pharmaceuticals, food, water, air, and forensic samples can all be analyzed using HPLC. The ability to accurately and reliably analyze these samples is crucial for ensuring the safety and quality of various products and substances."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The history of liquid chromatography dates back to the early 1900s when Russian botanist Mikhail Semyonovich Tswett invented a method for separating plant pigments using petroleum ether. He called this new technique “chromatography” because the result of the analysis was literally “written in color” along the length of the adsorbent column.\n Forty years later, Archer John Porter Martin and Richard Lawrence Millington Synge published a new type of partition chromatography that used silica gel in columns to separate amino acids, which led to the development of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In the 1970s, HPLC instruments saw significant improvements in technology, with the ability to develop up to 6,000 psi of pressure and incorporate improved injectors, detectors, and columns.\nFurther advances in instrumentation and column technology were made in 2004 to achieve ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) technology, with columns containing even smaller 1-micron-diameter particles and instrumentation capable of performing at 100,000 psi. Today, laboratories worldwide use HPLC to identify and quantify non- and semi-volatile chemical components in liquid samples.\nThe evolution of liquid chromatography has come a long way, with continuous research and development leading to significant improvements in performance, resolution, speed, and sensitivity. With the introduction of UPLC and UHPLC, the pressure race continues, providing a glimpse of what we may expect in the future.\nReferences:\n\nRonald E.

    "text": "Validation\n\nSelectivity\n\nSelectivity is the ability of an analytical method to measure the analyte in the presence of interfering substances in the blank biological matrix.\nTo evaluate selectivity, blank samples should be obtained from at least six individual sources/lots.\nSelectivity for the internal standard (IS) should also be evaluated.\nThe evaluation should show no significant response from interfering components at the retention time of the analyte or IS in the blank samples.\nInterfering component responses should not be more than 20% of the analyte response at the LLOQ and not more than 5% of the IS response in the LLOQ sample for each matrix.\nLipemic matrices should be tested using a representative matrix with high levels of triglycerides obtained from donors or spiked with triglycerides.\nHemolyzed matrices should be tested using a visibly detectable hemolyzed sample obtained by spiking matrix with hemolyzed whole blood (at least 2% V/V).\nLipemic and hemolyzed matrix testing is not necessary for nonclinical studies unless the drug impacts lipid metabolism or is administered in a particular animal strain that is hyperlipidemic.\n\n\n\nSpecificity\n\nSpecificity refers to a bioanalytical method’s ability to detect and differentiate the analyte from other substances.\nThis includes related substances, metabolites, isomers, impurities, degradation products, and concomitant medications.\nThe impact of related substances should be evaluated during method validation or in predose study samples.\nLC-MS based methods can assess the impact of related substances by comparing molecular weight and chromatographic separation.\nInterfering components should not contribute more than 20% of the analyte response at the LLOQ or 5% of the IS response in the LLOQ sample.\nBack-conversion of metabolites into the parent analyte should be evaluated, especially for unstable metabolites.\nPartial validation should be performed if needed, and the impact on study results should be discussed in the Bioanalytical Report.\n\n\n\nMatrix Effect\n\nA matrix effect is when the response of an analyte is altered due to unknown components in the sample matrix.\nDuring method validation, the matrix effect should be evaluated between different sources/lots.\nTo evaluate the matrix effect, at least three replicates of low and high quality controls should be analyzed using matrix from at least six different sources/lots.\nAccuracy should be within ±15% of the nominal concentration and precision should not be greater than 15% for each matrix source/lot evaluated.\nThe matrix effect should also be evaluated in relevant patient populations or special populations (e.g. hepatically impaired or renally impaired) when available.\nHemolyzed or lipemic matrix samples should be evaluated for matrix effect on a case-by-case basis, especially if these conditions are expected to occur in the study.\n\n\n\nCalibration Curve and Range\n\nThe calibration curve shows the relationship between the analyte concentration and the analytical platform’s response.\nCalibration standards, prepared by spiking known amounts of analyte into the matrix, make up the calibration curve.\nThe calibration range is defined by the lowest and highest calibration standards, known as the LLOQ and ULOQ.\nA calibration curve should be generated with a blank sample, a zero sample, and at least six concentration levels of calibration standards.\nThe regression model, weighting scheme, and transformation should be determined during method validation.\nThe accuracy of the back-calculated concentrations of each calibration standard should be within ±20% of the nominal concentration at the LLOQ and within ±15% at all other levels.\nAt least 75% of the calibration standards should meet the above criteria.\nIf a calibration standard does not meet the criteria, it should be rejected, and the calibration curve should be reevaluated.\nThe calibration curve should be prepared using freshly spiked calibration standards in at least one assessment.\nFrozen calibration standards can be used within their defined period of stability.\n\n\n\nAccuracy and Precision\n\nPreparation of quality control samples\n\nPrepare quality control samples by spiking matrix with a known quantity of analyte.\nStore the QCs under the same conditions as study samples and analyze them to validate the analytical method.\nUse separate stock solutions for calibration standards and QCs to avoid biased estimations.\nVerify the accuracy and stability of stock solutions if calibration standards and QCs are prepared from the same solution.\nUse a single source of blank matrix that is free of interference or matrix effects.\nPrepare QCs at a minimum of 4 concentration levels within the calibration curve range.\nQCs should include LLOQ, low QC, medium QC, and high QC.\nAnalyze low, medium, and high QCs in duplicate for non-accuracy and precision validation runs.\nUse QCs and calibration standards to determine acceptance or rejection of a run.\n\n\n\nEvaluation of accuracy and precision\n\nTo determine accuracy and precision, analyze QCs within each run and between runs.\nEvaluate accuracy and precision using at least three replicates per run at each QC concentration level in at least six runs over 2 or more days.\nReport within-run accuracy and precision data for each run and calculate an overall estimate if criteria are not met in all runs.\nCalculate between-run precision and accuracy by combining data from all runs.\nWithin-run and between-run accuracy should be within ±20% of nominal values, except for LLOQ and ULOQ which should be within ±25%.\nWithin-run and between-run precision should not exceed 20%, except at LLOQ and ULOQ where it should not exceed 25%.\nFor non-validation runs, at least 2/3 of total QCs and 50% at each concentration level should be within ±20% of nominal values.\nEvaluate total error (accuracy and precision) and ensure it does not exceed 30% (40% at LLOQ and ULOQ).\n\n\n\n\nCarryover\n\nInvestigate potential carryover in analytical platform by placing blank samples after ULOQ calibration standard.\nResponse of blank samples should be below LLOQ to avoid carryover.\n\n\n\nDilution Linearity and Hook Effect\n\nAssay range may require study samples to be diluted for accurate measurements\nDilution linearity should be assessed to confirm accuracy and avoid hook effect\nSame matrix as study sample should be used for QC preparation\nDilution QC should be generated with analyte concentration above ULOQ and tested at different dilution factors\nResponse reduction (hook effect) should be checked and mitigated if necessary\nMean concentration should be within ±20% of nominal concentration after correction for dilution\nPrecision should not exceed 20%\nDilution factors used in study sample analysis should be within validated range.\n\n\n\nStability\n\nStability evaluations ensure that sample preparation, processing, analysis, and storage conditions do not affect analyte concentration.\nStorage and analytical conditions used in stability tests should reflect those used for study samples.\nValidation of storage periods should be performed on QCs stored for equal or longer periods than study samples.\nLow and high concentration QCs should be analyzed at time zero and after storage conditions are evaluated.\nQCs should be analyzed against a calibration curve obtained from freshly spiked calibration standards and QCs.\nFreeze-thaw stability should be demonstrated with valid justification provided for macromolecules.\nQCs should be adjusted to represent the actual sample concentration range if consistently higher than ULOQ.\nFixed dose combination products require stability tests with matrix spiked with all dosed compounds.\nBench top, freeze-thaw, and long-term stability should be studied for all analytes.\nStability at one temperature can be extrapolated to lower temperatures for chemical drugs.\nBiological drugs can use a bracketing approach for stability testing.\n\n\n\nReinjection Reproducibility\n\nTo ensure the method’s reproducibility, multiple measurements of the QCs are necessary.\nPrecision and accuracy are evaluated through these measurements.\nIf samples are reinjected due to instrument interruptions or equipment failure, reinjection reproducibility should be assessed.\nThis evaluation confirms the processed samples’ viability and supports their storage before reinjection."

Acceptance Criteria for an Analytical Run\n\nAcceptance criteria for an analytical run must be defined in the protocol, study plan, or SOP.\nIf a run contains multiple batches, acceptance criteria should be applied to the whole run and individual batches.\nCalibration standards in a failed batch should not be used to support the acceptance of other batches within the analytical run.\nCalibration standards should have back-calculated concentrations within ±20% of the nominal value, except for LLOQ and ULOQ, which should be within ±25%.\nAt least 75% of calibration standards with a minimum of 6 concentration levels should meet this criterion, excluding anchor calibration standards.\nIf a calibration standard fails, it should be rejected, and a new regression analysis should be performed without it.\nIf the LLOQ is rejected, the new lower limit should be the next lowest acceptable calibration standard, and if the highest calibration standard is rejected, the new upper limit should be the next acceptable highest calibration standard.\nEach run should contain at least three levels of QCs (low, medium, and high), and at least 2/3 of the QCs and 50% at each concentration level should be within ±20% of the nominal value.\nOverall mean accuracy and precision of the QCs of all accepted runs should be calculated and reported in the analytical report.\nIf the overall mean accuracy and/or precision exceeds 20%, additional investigations should be conducted to determine the cause(s) of this deviation.\n\n\n\nCalibration Range\n\nIf the expected range of analyte concentrations in study samples is narrow, adjust the calibration curve range, QC concentrations, or add new QC levels to reflect the concentrations of the study samples.\nIf an unexpected clustering of study samples at one end of the calibration curve is encountered during sample analysis, stop the analysis and narrow the calibration curve range, revise QC concentrations, or add new QC levels before continuing with sample analysis.\nIf a large number of study sample concentrations are above the ULOQ, adjust the calibration curve range and QC levels or dilute the samples according to validated methods.\nEnsure at least two QC levels fall within the range of concentrations measured in study samples.\nIf the calibration curve range is changed, revalidate the bioanalytical method to ensure accuracy and precision.\n\n\n\nReanalysis of Study Samples\n\nPredefine reasons for reanalysis of study samples, number of replicates, and decision criteria in protocol or SOP before analysis begins\nDo not reject valid result for one analyte if another analyte fails acceptance criteria in samples with multiple analytes\nReport and discuss number of samples (and percentage) that have been reanalyzed in Bioanalytical Report\nReasons for study sample reanalysis may include rejected analytical run, significant difference in IS response, concentration above ULOQ, concentration below revised LLOQ, improper sample injection or equipment malfunction, diluted sample below LLOQ, quantifiable analyte levels in pre-dose or control samples, or poor chromatography\nDo not reanalyze study samples for PK reasons in comparative BA/BE studies to avoid bias\nIdentify reanalyzed samples in Bioanalytical Report with initial value, reason for reanalysis, values obtained in reanalyzes, final accepted value, and justification for acceptance; provide summary table of total number of samples reanalyzed for each reason\nIn cases where first analysis yields nonreportable result, single reanalysis is sufficient; replicate determinations required if sample volume allows for confirmation of value\nSafety of trial subjects takes precedence over any other aspect of trial; may need to reanalyze specific study samples for safety investigation\n\n\n\nReinjection of Study Samples\n\nReprocessed samples can be reinjected in case of equipment failure, but only if reinjection reproducibility has been demonstrated during validation or provided in the Bioanalytical Report.\nIt is not recommended to reinject a full analytical run or individual calibration standards or QCs simply because they failed without any identified analytical cause.\nThe focus should be on identifying the root cause of the failure rather than blindly reinjecting samples.\n\n\n\nIntegration of Chromatograms\n\nA study plan, protocol, or SOP should outline chromatogram integration and reintegration procedures.\nAny deviations from these procedures should be explained in the Bioanalytical Report.\nThe Bioanalytical Report should include a list of chromatograms that required reintegration and the reasons for it.\nBoth original and reintegrated chromatograms and integration results should be kept for future reference.\nAll of this information should be submitted in the Bioanalytical Report for comparative BA/BE studies."

It should be done before analyzing study samples if possible. Cross validation should involve measuring the same set of QCs in triplicate and study samples (if available) that span the concentration range with both methods or in both laboratories.\nBias can be assessed using Bland-Altman plots or Deming regression. Other methods like the concordance correlation coefficient may also be used. Alternatively, concentration vs. time curves for study samples can be plotted for samples analyzed by each method to assess bias.\nUsing multiple bioanalytical methods in one comparative BA/BE study is strongly discouraged."

    "text": "Methods for Analytes That Are Also Endogenous Molecules\nAnalyzing analytes that are also endogenous molecules can be challenging as accuracy may be affected when the method cannot differentiate between the therapeutic agent and the endogenous molecule. Additionally, endogenous levels of the analyte may vary due to various factors. This section covers approaches for assessing concentrations of analytes that are also endogenous molecules, excluding biomarkers.\nCalibration standards and QCs should ideally use the same biological matrix as study samples, free of matrix effect and interference. The biological matrix chosen should have low endogenous concentration to ensure a good signal-to-noise ratio.\nIf matrices without interference are unavailable, the following approaches can be used to calculate analyte concentration in study samples: surrogate matrix, surrogate analyte, background subtraction, and standard addition.\n\nSurrogate Matrix Approach\n\nSubstitute the matrix for calibration standards with a surrogate matrix, ranging from simple buffers to stripped matrices or matrices from other species.\n\nSurrogate Analyte Approach\n\nUse stable isotope labeled analytes as surrogate standards in mass spectrometric methods to construct the calibration curve, assuming physicochemical properties are the same except for molecular weight. Ensure the response factor is close to unity and constant over the entire calibration range.\n\nBackground Subtraction Approach\n\nSubtract the endogenous analyte concentration observed in a pooled/representative matrix from the concentration observed in spiked standards, then use the net differences to construct the calibration curve. Diluting blank matrices before spiking may cause different recoveries and matrix effects, which should be considered during validation.\n\nStandard Addition Approach\n\nUse only for analytical platforms with linear responses. Divide study samples into equal volume aliquots, and spike all but one with varying amounts of analyte standards to construct a calibration curve. Determine the endogenous blank concentration or study sample concentration as the negative x-intercept of the standard calibration curve prepared in that particular study sample.\n\n\nValidation of an analytical method for an endogenous analyte requires careful consideration of several factors:\n\nQuality Control Samples: Use matrices with low levels of interfering endogenous analyte and prepare QC samples that resemble study samples. Use both unspiked and spiked matrices to cover a range of concentrations.\nSelectivity, Recovery, and Matrix Effects: Assess selectivity by analyzing matrices from multiple donors. Recovery and matrix effects should be evaluated for calibration standards and study samples, and the impact of different matrices should be assessed.\nParallelism: Ensure that changes in response per given changes in analyte concentrations are equivalent for the surrogate and authentic biological matrix.\nAccuracy and Precision: Meet criteria for accuracy and precision specified in relevant sections. Use the formula to calculate accuracy when QCs are spiked with the authentic analyte in the matrix containing endogenous levels of the analyte.\nStability: Investigate stability with the authentic analyte in the authentic biological matrix and with unspiked/endogenous QCs, as well as spiked low QC and high QCs. If using a surrogate matrix, demonstrate stability for the analyte in the surrogate matrix."

    "text": "Hey there! Let’s talk about the different ways scientists separate compounds in liquid chromatography (LC). There are two main methods: isocratic and gradient.\nIsocratic separation just means using a constant mixture of solvents to separate compounds. It’s pretty straightforward and easy to do, but it might not always give the best results.\nGradient separation, on the other hand, uses a changing mixture of solvents to improve the separation process. This can lead to better peak shapes and faster analysis times. When scientists are developing a gradient mixing method, they can use either a binary or quaternary pump.\nBinary pumps mix solvents at high pressure, which is great for high-pressure gradient (HPG) analysis. Quaternary pumps, on the other hand, mix solvents at low pressure."

    "text": "Binary pump or High Pressure Gradient Pump\nDo you know what is the difference between binary and quaternary pumps?\nBinary pumps are the most popular pumps used in high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). They are known for their ability to create gradients using two solvents. They’re perfect for high-throughput and high-resolution (U)HPLC, or LC-MS applications.\nSo, how do binary pumps work? Well, they use two pump blocks and two solvent inlet lines to mix two individual solvents at high pressure. The two solvents are mixed in a mixing chamber after the pump heads, creating a high-pressure proportioning environment. This means that the solvents are already under pressure before they reach the mix-point where the mixing occurs.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s say you’re running a method that uses Solvent A and Solvent B at a ratio of 70:30. If your flow rate is 1.0 mL/min, the pumps would deliver 0.70 mL/min for Solvent A and 0.30 mL/min for Solvent B.\nBinary pumps are great for routine and high-throughput applications that require a two-solvent gradient. They’re easy to use and can be controlled using software. Plus, they’re capable of creating complex gradients that can be changed over time."

    "section": "What Is a Quaternary Pump or Low Pressure Mixing (LPM) pump",
    "text": "What Is a Quaternary Pump or Low Pressure Mixing (LPM) pump\nHey there! Today, I am going to talk about quaternary pumps. These pumps are used for separating different substances efficiently. The cool thing about them is that they can use up to four solvents for gradient separation.\nBasically, these pumps mix the solvents at low pressure, which is why they’re sometimes called low-pressure mixing (LPM) pumps or low-pressure gradient (LPG) pumps. Don’t worry if these terms sound confusing, they all mean the same thing.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, what is a quaternary pump? It’s a pump that uses up to four different solvents to create gradients. These pumps are great for method development or when you need flexibility in your mobile phase composition. They use a single pump block and four solvent inlet lines to mix the solvents. The first plunger withdraws the solvents under low pressure, while the second plunger pushes an accurate flow rate under high pressure into the system. The mixing of the solvents occurs inside the first plunger cylinder, or a mixer can be installed after the proportioning valve in some designs. But, what’s a proportioning valve? It’s a fancy piece of equipment that opens the valve of each solvent to deliver an equivalent amount to the pump heads. As an example, Let’s say you’re a scientist, and you need to mix solvent A, B, C, and D in equal parts. The proportioning valve would open the valve of each solvent to deliver an equivalent sized packet of solvent to the pump heads.\nSince these pumps use low-pressure mixing to create gradients. This means that solvent degassing or the use of a vacuum degasser is necessary. The pumps can be controlled by software and offer the flexibility to change the composition of the mobile phase over time. They’re perfect for scientists who need to run methods with different solvent ratios. So, why are these pumps so great? Well, they’re perfect for separating complex mixtures because they can use different solvents to create a gradient that separates the different substances. This means that you can get more accurate results and save time.\nAnother thing that’s awesome about quaternary pumps is that they’re really versatile. They can be used in a variety of industries, from pharmaceuticals to food and beverage.\nOne of the drawbacks is that they have a higher dwell volume. This means that it takes longer for the system to re-equilibrate after each sample is completed. It’s like waiting for a pot of water to boil - it takes longer if there’s more water in the pot.\nAnother issue with LPMs is that the extra dwell volume can create an isocratic hold if it’s not taken into account during a method transfer. This can cause problems down the line, so it’s important to be aware of it.\nIn summary, both binary and quaternary pumps have their pros and cons. It’s up to you to decide which one is best for your specific needs. But now you know a little more about these pumps, and that’s always a good thing!\nReferencs:\n\nDong\nvideo\nDong2\npaper"
